"Open your shop." We said. "I want to mod it and add useless stuff to it."

## What?
This is a dark theme for the Open Shop Channel.

## Why?
Because it looks nice? Because it reduces screen insomnia? Your guess.

## Contributions

## How?
I edit it in Inspect Element in Chrome, and modify images with paint.net.

## Who?
Please look at the fork owner's name. That's me.
